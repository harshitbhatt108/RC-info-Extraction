!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Extract_rc.ipynb(Jupyter Notebook) and Extract_RC.py(Python File) are same files, I've provided both so that there's no problem in opening the file if Jupyter Notebook notebook is not available!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This folder contains a Text Detection model for reading RCs. The main tool I've used for the Text detection in RCs is Python - Tesseract.  I have used Image enhancement functions to enhance the Color and the Brightness of the Images.
Then we convert the images to text, perform the splitting and intialize a list to store the extracted values. 
Then we extract the following fields from the RCs-
1. Licence Plate number or Regn number
2. VIN number or Chasis number
3. Name
4. Engine Number
5. Registration Date
6. Mfg. Date.

after extracting the data, I created a dataframe to store the extracted values and then display the data.
and finally we converted the dataframe to a csv(excel) file (RC_info.csv).

We can double check our result by displaying the contents of csv. I've done the displaying of the CSV.
